Setup Quick Link for Users
--------------------------

NOTE: IF you do not follow these steps exactly, it will NOT work! There is also a docx file with pictures in this folder if you prefer that alternative material. 

1. If you're already on sharepoint in the TDD Web App (local webapp) folder, skip to step 2. 
Otherwise, go to https://levelaccess.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/CX_Delivery/Shared%20Documents/CXDelivery_WebTools/TDD%20Web%20App%20(local%20webapp)?csf=1&web=1&e=TZNzd2
2. With the "TDD Web App (local webapp)" folder open, click on "Add shortcut to OneDrive". If you cannot find this button, make sure not files are currently marked as selected. 
Once this shortcut is added, it will make coming back to it easier. 
3. Go to your computers file explorer (not the OneDrive web app, this will not work) and open that folder. It may read as "CX_Delivery - TDD Web App (local webapp)".
4. Open the `index.html` file in Google Chrome (or your preferred browser).
5. Add this tab to your bookmarks for quick access.
